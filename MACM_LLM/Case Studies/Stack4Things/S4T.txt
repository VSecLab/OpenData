Stack4Things (S4T) is an open-source IoT platform designed to extend cloud computing infrastructures with native support for Internet of Things resources. Built as an evolution of the OpenStack ecosystem, Stack4Things enables the unified management of compute, storage, networking, and IoT devices within a single cloud-mediated framework. IoT devices such as sensors and actuators are treated as manageable resources, allowing them to be orchestrated, monitored, and controlled using cloud-oriented paradigms similar to those adopted for virtualized infrastructure.

The platform follows a distributed client–server architecture composed of cloud-side services, device-side agents, and management interfaces. The cloud-side control plane is centered around IoTronic, which provides the core functionalities for device management, service orchestration, and interaction with IoT nodes. IoTronic exposes REST APIs and integrates with standard OpenStack services, enabling users and administrators to manage fleets of devices, deploy plugins, and configure virtual networks. A web-based management interface, IoTronic UI, allows human operators to interact with the platform through a graphical dashboard.

The communication between the cloud and the devices is primarily based on the WAMP protocol, managed on the cloud side by a Crossbar broker and implemented through dedicated client and server libraries. This communication model supports bidirectional, asynchronous interactions between the cloud services and the devices. To enable connectivity even when devices are deployed behind NATs or firewalls, Stack4Things incorporates WSTUN, a tunneling mechanism that allows secure exposure of device-side services to the cloud and authorized users.

On the device side, each IoT node runs Lightning-rod, a lightweight agent responsible for maintaining the connection with the cloud, executing commands, and managing local services. Lightning-rod interacts with the underlying operating system and hardware interfaces, enabling access to sensors, actuators, and low-level system resources. Through Lightning-rod, the platform supports the injection and execution of custom plugins written in Python, allowing users to deploy application-specific logic directly on the devices. Plugins can be executed either synchronously or asynchronously and can be managed individually or across entire fleets of devices.

The platform also integrates several auxiliary services that support its operation. Messaging and event handling are facilitated through RabbitMQ, while persistent data storage is provided by databases such as MySQL and InfluxDB, the latter being used for time-series data collection from IoT devices. Identity and access management rely on Keystone, and trust establishment is supported through a Certificate Authority, enabling secure authentication and encrypted communication channels across the system.

From a networking perspective, Stack4Things explicitly distinguishes between cloud, wide-area, and local-area networks, with routing components mediating communication across these domains. End users interact with the platform through web interfaces or exposed services, which may include device-side HTTP or SSH endpoints securely tunneled through the cloud infrastructure.

Overall, Stack4Things provides a flexible and extensible environment for integrating IoT devices into cloud infrastructures, supporting use cases ranging from smart environments and industrial automation to cyber-physical systems and large-scale IoT deployments. Its modular design, reliance on standard cloud technologies, and support for remote device management make it a suitable foundation for both operational deployments and research-oriented experimentation.
