The pairing process, begins by activating the pairing mode on the device, during which the device creates a SoftAP network (Step 1). The user then scans a QR code via the eWeLink app (Step 2), which contacts the Coolkit backend to retrieve
the device key (Step 3). Once received, the app encrypts (through the key of the device) and sends the home Wi-Fi SSID and password through the Sonoff SoftAP network (Steps 4–5). Finally, the device reconnects to the home Wi-Fi and confirms pairing (Step 6).
