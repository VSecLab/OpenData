The Open Energy Monitor (OEM) system is an open-source platform for control automation and monitoring of several home appliances, such as smart sockets, power production/consumption
measurements, control of charging stations for electric cars, room temperature and humidity, outdoor temperature and so forth.  The OEM system is based on several modules and leverages on two separate base stations, namely the emonPi and emonBase stations, to collect data from other devices. The EmonTh module measures the environmental temperature and humidity levels, while the emonTx monitors the home power consumption and production. Finally, the WiFi MQTT Relay is a general purpose relay, which can be controlled remotely through the MQTT protocol. Data collected from the distributed devices is stored on the base station and can be visualized through the EmonCMS web application.
