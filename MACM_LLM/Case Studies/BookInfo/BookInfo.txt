The Bookinfo application is  a widely adopted benchmark provided by the Istio service mesh framework. The application is specifically designed as a representative microservice-based system, offering a realistic yet controlled environment for experimenting with cloud-native deployment, service interaction, and security validation.

The Bookinfo application simulates an online retail scenario in which users can view information about a book, including its description, details, and reviews. While conceptually simple, the system exhibits the architectural characteristics of modern distributed applications. It is composed of multiple loosely coupled microservices, each encapsulated in its own container, and interconnected through well-defined APIs. This structure reflects typical design patterns of cloud-native applications, making it particularly suitable for research on DevSecOps automation.

At its core, the system includes the following main services: (i) productpage: the entry point of the application, responsible for dynamically assembling book information by querying other backend services; (ii) details service: provides additional metadata about the book, such as the author, publication year, and other descriptive fields; (ii) reviews service: aggregates user-generated reviews for the book. (iii) ratings service: manages the rating values associated with user reviews, typically relying on a simple data store.

The application is described through a docker compose that enable its deployment over a single machine starting a docker container for each of the microservices above described.
