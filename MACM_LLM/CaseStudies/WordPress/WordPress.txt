The system consists of three virtual machines in a cloud environment.
The first one runs a WordPress application on top of an Apache web
server. A second machine provides the mySQL database, which stores
and manages all application data. A third machine operates as a Load
Balancer, distributing incoming client requests toward the
WordPress instance. The WordPress application interacts with the
database to retrieve and update information, while the Load Balancer
ensures that all external requests are directed to the web
application.
