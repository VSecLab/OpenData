## Abstract

The growing adoption of edge computing has introduced new architectural paradigms and increased complexity in IoT ecosystems. This shift, while beneficial in terms of latency, bandwidth, and resilience, also brings unresolved security challengesâ€”particularly in platforms like KubeEdge, which extend Kubernetes functionalities to the edge. In this paper, we present a structured and automated security assessment of a real-world KubeEdge deployment by applying an expert system-based methodology (ESSecA). ESSecA adopts a threat-driven, model-based, and knowledge-supported approach to generate threat models, perform risk analysis, and plan penetration tests. We model the system using the MACM formalism, capturing both components and their interactions. The assessment reveals several security issues, especially concerning the MQTT-based communication between edge and IoT devices. We executed a set of penetration tests, including message tampering and unauthorized device control, exploiting insecure configurations in the MQTT broker. The identified vulnerabilities confirm the need for systematic security evaluations in edge environments. We propose countermeasures and outline future work aimed at enhancing the formal model to support dynamic system configurations and automated mitigation selection. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report in the literature regarding a comprehensive security assessment of a KubeEdge deployment. This work aims to fill that gap by providing the first such analysis.

## Contents
- [KubeEdge_MusicPlayer_QUATIC.macm](KubeEdge_MusicPlayer_QUATIC.macm): This file contains the formal model of the KubeEdge Music Player application, created using the MACM (Multi-purpose Application Composition Model) formalism. MACM utilizes the Cypher query language to describe the system, enabling comprehensive security analysis.
- [KubeEdge Player (QUATIC)_threat_model.xlsx](KubeEdge_Player_(QUATIC)_threat_model.xlsx): This spreadsheet documents the threat model developed during the threat modeling phase.
- [KubeEdge Player (QUATIC)_attack_plan-2.xlsx](KubeEdge_Player_(QUATIC)_attack_plan-2.xlsx): The attack plan used in the pentest.

## Testbed Configuration

The environment used for this case study reflects the official demo setup, available at [KubeEdge Pi-Player App Demo](https://github.com/kubeedge/examples/blob/master/web-demo/).

## Risk Analysis - Threat Agent Selection

### Threat Agent Questionnaire

1. Are there someone who can gain an advantage implementing a cyber threat against your system?
   - [x] Yes
   - [ ] No, the threats that apply to the system are related only to non-hostile situation
2. Do you trust all employees and do you assume that they are not a possible Threat agent?
   - [ ] Consider as "trusted" the employees
   - [x] Consider all threat agents
3. What are the goals of the attackers that represent the most threat to you?
   - [x] Make a replica of the asset so the agent has simultaneous access to it.
   - [x] Denial of the assets
   - [ ] The agent does not have a rational plan, or may make a choice opportunistically at the time of attack.
   - [ ] Destroy the asset, which becomes worthless to either Intel or the agent.
   - [ ] Damage the asset, which remains in owner's possession but has only limited functionality or value.
   - [x] Gain possession of the asset
4. What could be the expected results of a possible attacker in the phases of a possible attack on the software system?
   - [x] Theft
   - [x] Cause harm
   - [ ] Embarassment
   - [ ] Tech Advantage
   - [ ] Business Advantage
